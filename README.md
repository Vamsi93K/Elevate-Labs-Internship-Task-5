# Sales Data Analysis Using Python and Pandas

This project analyzes customer sales data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib in a Jupyter/Colab notebook. It demonstrates how to extract meaningful insights from a CSV file using core data analysis techniques like grouping, aggregation, and visualization.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains transactional sales records with the following columns:

- `Customer Name`
- `Purchase Date`
- `Product Category`
- `Sale`
- `Quantity`
- `Discount Applied`
- `Purchase Year`, `Month`, `Day`
- `Price`


## Objectives

- Load and explore a real-world CSV dataset
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Use `groupby()`, `sum()`, and `mean()` to extract insights
- Visualize trends using `plot()`, `bar()`, and `line()` charts
- Identify top-performing categories and customers
- Understand the impact of discounts on sales


## Key Insights

- Total and average sales per product category
- Monthly sales trends across the year
- Top 10 customers by total sales
- Sales comparison between discounted and non-discounted transactions
- Price vs Quantity scatter plot by category


## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I learned how to:

- Use Pandas for data manipulation and aggregation
- Create visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Write clean, well-commented code in Jupyter/Colab
- Structure a data analysis workflow from raw CSV to insights
- Communicate findings effectively using markdown and charts

## Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Reference Tutorial

This project was inspired and guided by the Pandas tutorial from GeeksforGeeks:  
[GeeksforGeeks Pandas Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pandas/pandas-tutorial/)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook
2. Open in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
3. Upload the CSV file (`Customer Sale Dataset for Visualization.csv`)
4. Run each cell to explore the data and view insights
5. 
## Future Enhancements

- Add interactive charts using Plotly
- Build a dashboard with Streamlit
- Export summary tables to Excel or PDF
- Analyze seasonal patterns by category
